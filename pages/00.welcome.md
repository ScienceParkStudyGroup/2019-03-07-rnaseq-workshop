# Welcome

## Purposes of today
- To __"demagify"__ and __demystify__ RNA-Seq
- To give you an overview of the different steps involved in a typical RNA-Seq workflow.

## Outline
What is RNA-Seq for? We should say mRNA-Seq.
How do you sequence a transcriptome?
What are some tools to perform RNA-Seq?

Main output of mRNA-Seq: differentially expressed genes between experimental conditions

A short introduction of instructors: Tijs, Ernest and Me.
A short introduction of the helpers of today: Max and Fred.
