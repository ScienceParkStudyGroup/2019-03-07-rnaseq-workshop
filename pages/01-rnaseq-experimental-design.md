## RNA-Seq experimental design
I will introduce some technical and methodological notions regarding mRNA-Seq in this [presentation](../presentations/rna-seq_design.pdf)

## Credits
This presentation was taken from the extensive RNA-Seq course given by the [Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/).
