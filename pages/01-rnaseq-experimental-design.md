## Introduction of the workshop
This workshop serves as a pilot for a longer combined theoretical and practical course that we aim to organise during the next academic year.  

Who we are:
- Tijs Bliek is a technician working in the group of Prof. Ronald Koes (Epigenetics & Developmental Biology, SILS-UvA). Tijs is regularly performing genomic analyses 
- Ernest Aliche is a post-doctorate fellow working in the group of Prof. Harro Bouwmeester (Epi)
